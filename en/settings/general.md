### Product Visibility

POS only products should only be enabled if you require some products to be hidden from either the online or physical store. 
Please see the [POS Only Products](/products/pos-only-products.html) doc for more information.

### Default POS Customer

A new order will initialise with the default POS customer. Common options are:
 
* **Guest:** POS orders are not associated with any user id
* **Cashier:** POS orders are associated with the logged in user's account
* **Walk-in Customer:** POS orders are associated with a custom user account (_note: this account will need to be created_)

[WooCommerce POS Pro](https://wcpos.com/pro) users are able to create user accounts _on-the-fly_ during checkout. 
An email address is required to create a new account, this is a requirement of WordPress. 
**Creating an account for new customers is recommended** as it means you can track their order history and potentially contact your customers with promotional offers in the future.
