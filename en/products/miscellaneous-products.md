There may be cases when a store needs to sell items that are not part of the WooCommerce inventory. 
Below are two options for selling 'miscellaneous products' in WooCommerce POS.

### POS Only Miscellaneous Product (recommended)

Using the [POS Only](./pos-only-products.html) feature, you can create a 'miscellaneous product' for use in the POS. 
The title, sale price, regular price, tax rate and meta information can all be changed on-the-fly during checkout.

### Fee line item

Using a Fee line item is similar to creating a POS Only Miscellaneous Product. 
Cashiers can quickly update the title, price and tax rate of Fee. 
The main drawback is that Fee's may appear separate to products in your reporting.
