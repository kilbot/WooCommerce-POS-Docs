WooCommerce POS Pro adds the ability to create separate *stores* for your physical sales. 
Stores can have their own address, logo and other details for use on the [receipt template](receipts.html). 
Stores can use different tax rates and Sales can be separated by store for [reporting](reports.html#sales-by-store).
